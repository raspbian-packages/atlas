ATLAS provides portably optimal BLAS (and some LAPACK routines)
implementations for cache-based architectures.  The ATLAS homepage is:
   http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/
and it provides full details.

The ATLAS FAQ answers many ATLAS questions, and it is available:
    http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/faq.html

As the FAQ explains, ATLAS includes both stable and developer (unstable)
releases.  All known problems with the stable release are documented in
the stable errata file:
    http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html

The stable errata also lists a great deal of known system issues, etc,
and is the first place you should look if you have install problems.  Even
users of the developer release should still scope the stable errata, to
see if they are experiencing one of the system problems documented there.

The developer (unstable) releases use the bug tracker as their only errata.
Look for all open and pending bugs in the developer group at:
   https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?group_id=23725&atid=379482

The way to get ATLAS support (install problems, etc) is described in the
ATLAS FAQ at:
