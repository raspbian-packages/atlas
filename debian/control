Description: Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software, generic shared
 ATLAS is an approach for the automatic generation and optimization of
 numerical software. Currently ATLAS supplies optimized versions for the
 complete set of linear algebra kernels known as the Basic Linear Algebra
 Subroutines (BLAS), and a subset of the linear algebra routines in the
 LAPACK library.
 .
 The libraries in this package are built without any processor extension
 instructions, and should run on all processors of this general
 architecture, albeit less than optimally.  
 . 
 If you want to create an ATLAS packaged optimized for your processor, see the
 section: "Building Optimized Atlas Packages on your ARCH" in README.Debian

Description: Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software, generic static
 ATLAS is an approach for the automatic generation and optimization of
 numerical software. Currently ATLAS supplies optimized versions for the
 complete set of linear algebra kernels known as the Basic Linear Algebra
 Subroutines (BLAS), and a subset of the linear algebra routines in the
 LAPACK library.
 .
 This package includes the headers, the static libraries and symbolic links
 needed for program development.

Description: Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software, test programs
 ATLAS is an approach for the automatic generation and optimization of
 numerical software. Currently ATLAS supplies optimized versions for the
 complete set of linear algebra kernels known as the Basic Linear Algebra
 Subroutines (BLAS), and a subset of the linear algebra routines in the
 LAPACK library.
 .
 This package provides dynamically linked testing and bench-marking
 binaries to compare the BLAS and ATLAS libraries on your system.

Description: Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software, documentation
 ATLAS is an approach for the automatic generation and optimization of
 numerical software. Currently ATLAS supplies optimized versions for the
 complete set of linear algebra kernels known as the Basic Linear Algebra
 Subroutines (BLAS), and a subset of the linear algebra routines in the
 LAPACK library.
 .
 This package provides documentation on the ATLAS libraries useful for
 developers.
