Description: Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software, generic shared
 ATLAS is an approach for the automatic generation and optimization of
 numerical software. Currently ATLAS supplies optimized versions for the
 complete set of linear algebra kernels known as the Basic Linear Algebra
 Subroutines (BLAS), and a subset of the linear algebra routines in the
 LAPACK library.
 .
 The libraries in this package are built without any processor extension
 instructions, and should run on all processors of this general
 architecture, albeit less than optimally.  
 . 
 Before version 3.8.3-25, optimized binary packages were provided.
 However, due to the fact that most Atlas optimisation are done at build time,
 it has been decided to remove them and give priority to locally built packages.
 . 
 For more information on how to rebuild locally atlas, see the section:
 "Building Optimized Atlas Packages on your ARCH" in README.Debian
