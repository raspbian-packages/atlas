    More precisely, add missing GENERIC32/lapack/gcc/atlas_{c,z}GetNB_geqrf.h in
    debian/archdef/mips/GENERIC32.tar.bz2. The absence of these files was making
    the compilation insanely long on some buildds, causing FTBFS by timeout.

  * libatlas3-base: add dependency on libblas-common.
    The goal is to make BLAS implementations multi-arch safe by preventing the
    co-installability of, say, libblas3:amd64 and libatlas3-base:i386. See
  * Drop obsolete note in libatlas3-base package description about former

atlas (3.10.2-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * shared_libraries.diff: no longer include ATLAS-specific symbols in
    libblas.so and liblapack.so. Rather dynamically link those libraries with
    libatlas.so. This makes it possible to use liblapack.so from ATLAS with a
    libblas.so coming from somewhere else. Thanks to Guillem Jover for
    suggesting this solution. (Closes: #576972)
  * Revert back to a higher priority in the LAPACK alternatives.
    The priority had been lowered in 3.8.4-8 in order to minimize the incidence
    of #576972, so this is no longer needed.

    libblas.so.3gf => libblas.so.3 and liblapack.so.3gf => liblapack.so.3.

atlas (3.10.1-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * libatlas-base-dev now provides liblapack.so.
  * Remove unused libatlas-3.so, libatlas-3gf.so and libatlas.so.* virtual
    packages.
  * Rewrite logic in libatlas3-base.postinst. (Closes: #719142)
  * Disable autodetection of machine type on archs for which ATLAS does not
    provide generic-enough architectural defaults. This is achieved by creating
    a GENERIC machine type (see generic.diff). In particular, this ensures that
    the package created on an armel buildd with an ARMv7 will be generic.
    (Closes: #719355)
  * Register documentation to doc-base.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.5, no changes needed.

 -- Sébastien Villemot <sebastien@debian.org>  Wed, 29 Jan 2014 19:23:08 +0100

    enabled. Otherwise the package FTBFS on some buildds (e.g. biber).
    Implementation is done by reactivating the "-Si cputhrchk 0" flag
    (cpu-throtthling-check.diff), and using it in debian/rules.
  * Add architectural defaults for armel and mips.
  * armhf.diff: do not enforce 32-registers FPU for Fortran

atlas (3.10.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Sylvestre Ledru ]
  * New upstream release (Closes: #609287)

  [ Sébastien Villemot ]
  * Provide architectural defaults (i.e. precomputed timings) for all
    release archs (except armel and mips for the time being, due to slow
    porterboxes). This will make the package build much faster and should
    eliminate transient build failures due to excessive variance in the
    timings.
  * Move symlinks for lib{cblas,f77blas,atlas,lapack_atlas} out of the
    libblas.so.3 alternative and make them always present, so that
    software relying on these libs do not break when another alternative
    is selected for BLAS
  * ATLAS now has improved ARM support with native asm constructs. This required
    the following tunes:
    + armel-is-v4t.diff: new patch, prevents FTBFS on armel; otherwise,
      ATLAS uses asm constructs too recent for the platform (armel is only v4t)
    + debian/rules: on armhf, define the ATL_ARM_HARDFP flag; otherwise the asm
      constructs use the soft-float ABI for passing floating points
    + on armhf, ensure that -mfloat-abi=softfp and -mcpu=vfpv3 flags are never
      used; this is implemented via a patch (armhf.diff) and by the use of fixed
      archdefs
  * The generic package is now built without multi-threading, because otherwise
    the package fails to build on some single-processor machines (this required
    the introduction of a patch: fix-non-threaded-build.diff). As a side effect,
    the build of the custom package gracefully handles non-threaded
    builds. (Closes: #602524)
  * Add libblas.a as slave in the libblas.so alternative (Closes: #701921)
  * Add symlinks for lib{f77blas,atlas}.a in /usr/lib (Closes: #666203)
  * Modify shlibs file of libatlas3-base, such that packages using
    libblas/liblapack depend on any BLAS/LAPACK alternative, while packages
    depending on ATLAS-specific libraries (e.g. libatlas.so) depend specifically
    on libatlas3-base.
  * corei1.diff: remove patch, applied upstream
  * Use my @debian.org email address
  * Remove obsolete DM-Upload-Allowed flag
  * Switch VCS to git
  * Remove Conflicts/Replaces against pre-squeeze packages
  * libatlas-base-dev now provides libblas.so, as libblas-dev
  * No longer use -Wa,--noexecstack in CFLAGS, it makes the package FTBFS
  * Do not use POWER3 arch for powerpcspe port (Closes: #701068)
  * Bump to debhelper compat level 9
  * README.Debian: mention that devscripts is needed to compile the custom
    package (Closes: #697431)
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.4. As a consequence, add Built-Using
    fields because the package embeds stuff from liblapack-pic

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * libatlas3gf-base: Add Breaks: octave3.2  (Closes: #706328)
    This fixes some upgrade paths by removing the obsolete octave3.2 (and its
    triggers) a bit earlier. This is a workaround for dpkg bug #671711: dpkg
    may run trigger processing for a package even if its dependencies are not
    satisfied. The octave3.2 triggers may be run in such a state (with
    liblapack* and libblas* unpacked but unconfigured, therefore the
    alternatives may not be setup or dangling) and will fail, aborting the
    upgrade, even if octave3.2 would be removed later anyway.
    Similar Breaks exist in libblas3 and libarpack2 to cover more incarnations
    of this bug.

atlas3 (3.6.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Port recent bug fixes from atlas2, listed below.
  * Fixed development alternatives to go with the new library locations.
  * Bug fix: "atlas3-base-dev: Depends on g77 is missing", thanks to
    Torsten Werner ( #226376). Added to all -dev packages.
  * Bug fix: "atlas3-headers: Does have all needed header files for
    compiling other programs using atlas", thanks to Tomas Ukkonen
    ( #227453). Added include/atlas_aux.h and
    include/Linux_base_static/atlas_type.h  to atlas3-headers pkg.
  * Bug fix: "The package description does not follow Debian policy",
    thanks to Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña ( #209452). Reworded
    descriptions.
  * Bug fix: "atlas3-base: package description is suboptimal", thanks to
    Jochen Voss ( #227752).  Reworded descriptions.  Binary
    packages suggest blas and lapack to assist in debugging, as any
    program linking against one of these libraries can be cross checked
    against the reference versions at runtime without recompilation via
    the use of the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.  -dev packages
    suggest both blas-doc and lapack-doc.  -test package recommends blas
    and lapack.
  * Bug fix: "atlas: Please switch to gettext-based debconf templates",
    thanks to Christian Perrier ( #205812).  Ran automated
    procedure on templates.
  * Bug fix: "atlas: French translation of gettext debconf templates",
    thanks to Christian Perrier ( #206596). Installed po/fr.po.
  * Fixed expect build depends for newer expect package
  * Moved library locations to better take advantage of new hwcap behavior
    in ldconfig.  Atlas supplied blas and lapack libraries are now in
    /usr/lib/atlas/{,sse,sse2,3dnow,etc}/.  Edited templates accordingly.

    process.  A custom 'config' program is compiled and run, which prompts
    the user for certain information, and writes the toplevel Makefiles.
    This procedure doesn't fit well with automated building under Debian,
    so a (pair of) generic Makefiles has been provided for compilation on
    Debian systems.  Some fields were inadvertantly left in these files
    which pertain to the specific hardware of this maintainer, making
    building on some machines impossible.  This update should allow for
    proper building on all Debian systems.  Furthermore, these Makefiles
    have been verified to produce libraries with essentially the same
    performance on the matintainer's hardware. In the future, perhaps the
    proper way to do this is to run the atlas config program under some
    special shell, like 'expect'.  This would in addition require
    automated editing of these files by debian/rules.

atlas (2.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added LD_LIBRARY_PATH to dh_shlibdeps to get dependencies right on
  machines where atlas and blas are not installed :-)
