Description: Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software, generic shared
 ATLAS is an approach for the automatic generation and optimization of
 numerical software. Currently ATLAS supplies optimized versions for the
 complete set of linear algebra kernels known as the Basic Linear Algebra
 Subroutines (BLAS), and a subset of the linear algebra routines in the
 LAPACK library.
 .
 The libraries in this package are built without any processor extension
 instructions, and should run on all processors of this general
 architecture, albeit less than optimally.  
 . 
 If you want to create an ATLAS packaged optimized for your processor, see the
 section: "Building Optimized Atlas Packages on your ARCH" in README.Debian
